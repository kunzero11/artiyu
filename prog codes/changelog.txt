changelog 

prior notice : I have decided to use this website builder for easy construction of my website, the only downside of this site builder is that you can't have multiple pages and editing html elements is not eligible because it is for pro version only so i'm sorry to dissapoint you but no, your gonna see one page of this website only (blog posts excluded)

- November 15 - rate button now included (external links to youpoll.me)
